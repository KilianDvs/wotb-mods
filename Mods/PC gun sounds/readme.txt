V 4.1_3.3
Optimized the .fev files
	-quality on audio dropped (minor difference in sounds but significant drop in file size and should increase in performance)

		It will use more ram than before but it reduces the occasion of the CPU under stress due to most of the sounds all ready in the RAM to play
